2, i'm an academic sort of; fwiw i suspected that it would go like this but wanted to hedge my bets not just against twitter possibly failing but also (&amp; more likely) against the platform taking some direction i wouldn't like so i have a mastodon too (and it's nice over there)

2,time is the issue here
0,   i'm imagining an indian version of charles bronson
0,4/ still thinking does require effort we can feel overwhelmed when we're faced with too many decisions and this state likely does have undersirable effects on our performance even if it doesn't necessarily work like a character's life bar in a video game
1, now i’m gonna trash-talk wittgenstein in my own private mental language that i just made up that is in no way latin :-p
0, that's one idea another is to have a website like https://tco/emumfq6hdq where people put info in several columns along with a short essay; then an open source code picks out the profiles you want and could use an algorithm to suggest choices but only if desired
2,   when i talk to strangers at parties and things i use lines like that one but for a dating app i agree it's best to personalize as much as you can forgot about that prolly because i've been off the apps for a while now

1, oy i'd really rather not see that guy in my feed
1,   for example sometimes it’s not a goal we need so much as an anti-fragile self-sustaining process; people often solve the wrong problem “really rightly” by doing cost benefit analyses for end states that can’t be or don’t need to be specified
1, i agree with that at the same time between thanksgiving and christmas nyc becomes intolerable in many places too much of a good thing for me atleast

0,  i should also mention that inter-paradigm critique would be involved ie criticizing each perspective from the vantage points of all the others

- knowledge of the most common cognitive biases and de-biasing techniques
- bayes's equation
- brier scores
- game theory
- linear models 
- decision trees"
1,what i do: use critical systems thinking ideas from the behavioral sciences and machine learning to support decision making
0, some of those criticisms remind me of a common criticism of systems thinking: that we can't know everything relevant to a complex situation along with all interconnections but since systems thinking is only about striving to do the best we can it's just shooting the messenger
3, i now consider myself to be a wisp new identity :-|
2,i keep wanting to play with the idea of using systems approaches designed for collective decision making to improve individual decision making by considering multiple perspectives that are self-generated
0, but yeah a different model could use a single point; comparing results between these models could be informative
0, at least he doesn’t micromanage 😂
2, i'm inconsistent in viewing the mistakes of others vs myself for others i think that people do the best they can and i don't think people should just suffer if they do something bad (ie i'm not a retributionist) but somehow it feels self-serving to apply that to myself
0,"i think about these a lot:

(1) system dynamics
(2) vanguard method
(3) viable system model
(4) socio-technical systems engineering
(5) strategic assumption surfacing
(6) interactive planning
(7) soft systems methodology
(8) critical systems heuristics
(9) team syntegrity"
5,i used to love reading these physics books by landau and lifshitz because they were so concise and clear as to be beautiful; part of the allure of twitter is attempting to make ideas as beautiful as they can be by using as few words as possible

6,not a life coach or a consultant but a third more mysterious thing

1, this reminds me of that poll where doctors said that doctors other than themselves were influenced by small gifts from pharm companies it can’t be true of all doctors but some of them could have been right
3,  if i defeat such a date do i get to absorb her powers
6,i kinda wish that rationalists would get together and design the most effective dating site i do think that what we have now (reciprocity google docs) is prolly better than the usual apps but i also think it could likely be much better still

1, i want to say yes; “want” is the key word here
13,learning institutions should have degree programs in integrative science in which biology/chemistry/physics are taught together not like neapolitan ice cream flavors but by showcasing how they are inextricably tangled up in the real-world’s pressing problems
5," at first i read ""mathematics literally won't run"" and thought ""math needs a server"""
1, i'm in an academic teaching contract until spring semester is over it might be possible to break it but currently i'm thinking to stuff myself with ai knowledge and apply like a crazy person nearer to that time
0,"""applying to what"" is the last thing i'm not sure but i think those positions are just called ""decision scientist""; i can poke around on https://tco/a3o1er4hfn and other things later today to find out more now maybe my brain will let me sleep"
2, i’m on the 1st and since it doesn’t really have stuff on neural nets supplementing w/the 2nd https://tco/5efye2n7fx

1," sometimes it even translates lingua latīna as ""english"" ha ha but i've kind of grown fond of hurling insults at it: caudex (blockhead)"
2,  https://tco/yehro9mg2w
2, yes; at the same time it’s prolly also a good idea to keep in mind plausible uses for example thinking of things we are grateful for seems to be useful against the adaptation level phenomenon; growth mindset seems useful in the sense that it encourages at least trying

3,and i've worked with regularization principal component analysis etc before as well the only thing that's been totally new so far has been sql and this stuff having to do with neural nets so gotta hit those areas hard

1,5/ for the organisms to be purposeful it would need a kind of executive control center that factors in what's going on in the other systems to some extent and gives meaning to the organism's experience

1," i meant that there may be some kind of fundamental disconnect that words can never quite fill but i also meant it literally because i'm stranded in new jersey ha 

it's definitely hard to run into people irl like the eas on here i'll figure it out someday (i hope)"
1,can barely fargin contain myself on here
1, “ambitious” - i like that way of putting it most days i express it as “possibly crazy” 😅
1, don’t worry i won’t tell
1, like i want my huel shaker cup to have latex support :-|
3,  i’ve been highly tempted to go in that direction too
6, i’m reading “the alignment problem” and only 30 pg in it’s pretty clear that there are major issues eg test data not representing minorities enough leading to ai-based decision support software (for example one having to do w/whether to grant parole) being racist/sexist etc
0,5/ my question to you dear reader is this: would you find it useful to role play these groups' positions yourself and be led through the process described above for some issue of importance to you ie to simulate a sast workshop but with just you and a facilitator
0, i mean that whole time-traveling-zombie-space-pirates thing was pretty surprising
4, i live in a weird quantum superposition where anything could turn out to be something else

3,not into retributive justice
0, this could be a partial solution maybe i could tutor on the side of whatever else i’m doing
2,   i feel like worldview is more neutral with approx the same content
1, if prov(p) implies (p) has been proven in some axiom system (the syntactic view) then any model that makes prov(p) be true also makes p be true (that's the semantic view) so we can't make a model that mistakenly says prov(p) when p is false that must mean that p is true
1, i think i finally get the rat-on-heroine thing now
3,  yes that's what i wanted u to think cuz i'm so bad
4,getting so caught up in the formalization of a problem that the goal is forgotten = mathturbation

4,if i combine any more improbable pursuits i'm pretty sure a black hole will form and destroy new jersey
1,   thanks for the reminder - i spend so much time thinking about de-biasing that it's easy to lose track of the reality that heuristics are often super helpful and it makes sense that signalling often would be too :)
9,"is it me or do stock market changes always get reported with a suggested cause

12,standard python is written in c whaaaaaa i'm suprised there's not a humongous memory leak somewhere
1,  i guess it's one thing to incidentally send a signal by doing something and other to do that thing specifically to send the signal i feel like people sometimes commit the sin of telling others what their intentions are here
1,   (mumbles ) something something category theory something types :-|
1, re-structuring seems different from triage: in the former one changes the situation so that certain choices never arise in the first place; in the latter problems are categorized and handled differently based on that grouping
4,or things that make u smile :)
1, that makes sense i’ve taken to wearing cap sleeve shirts sometimes and jeans w/out holes

0, i'm not social awkwardness itself though sometimes i feel like possibly i am ha
1,"  i try to simulate that way of thinking to some extent by temporarily inhabiting paradigms that i don't necessarily think are correct 😅 

i think of the alternative belief sets as ""stuff i believe in a parallel universe"" which might end up being this one after all"
1,   i’m certainly open to contract work; all this looks good thanks
9,i don’t have experience in industry and that worries me so far the idea is to overwhelm w/evidence of python r sql and decision sci badassery damn i hope it works
0,"sometimes i feel like everything i know is about structuring i'm a bunch of lenses you can look through and go ""oh neat"""
2,  it's a strong source of corroborative evidence: when theory experiment and computation converge it raises confidence that we've got something
1,i'm not sure that even given an infinite amount of time the ability annoy eliezer yudkowsky over and over again with my questions etc that i could figure these things out especially problem (5)
1,   often just looking at a problem from a different perspective greatly simplifies it when it seems like we’re getting bogged down in complexity that’s often a sign that we’re looking through the wrong lens and sometimes you just have to do the old-fashioned analysis
1, yes this is an old friend :-)

5, yes now tomorrow when i eff up royally i can just chant “regression to the mean” 😌
0," i had a friend who put a dis-acknowledgements section in his thesis ""thanks to x y z for actively getting in the way of my research"""
1, i’m with you: better to stay self-partnered than be with someone who isn’t a good fit
1, that makes sense and it's particularly relevant to my current situation as i'm working on a business while taking care of my official job simultaneously which hopefully won't always be the case
2,"  this sounds like a condition i may suffer from

i'll have to check him out :)"
3,started writing fargin student exam (1 of 2)

2, 0 to 100 was like giving birth for me man 😅
7,"nietzsche is trending which means lots and lots of people are cutting and pasting ""nietzsche"" because nobody including me can spell it"

1, good luck 🙏
1,i understand the mathematical basis of those algorithms as well as for neural nets
0, hmm but it isn't perfect because it's unclear what advantage the fox could gain by striving to reach them (good exercise)
1," interesting it seems like a special case of rationalization since that can be used to diffuse lots of other things that don't make sense too 

but sour graphes sounds pretty good the fox can't reach the grapes and so devalues them"
1, super well-written; i learned a lot too
1, and in research trying to get your ideas accepted can feel like you're dealing with a bunch of the most disagreeable types ever ha
0, pyspark sounds nice
2,if i walked outside one day to find that the world were suddenly made of chocolate populated by furries and obeyed none of the laws of physics i'd be pretty ok with that :|
1, i am; they're great
1,i need so badly to revive the latin my soul is dying

1, woah i just can't even
4, oh okay yes this looks better than using csvreader thanks
1, sweet
7,and it's important that it not be loaded w/many things because wide disagreement within a social group needs to be possible if that group aspires toward maximum rationality

7,help i’ve been data framed
2,   when i think about it maybe it's not quite true: like if i were helping one person i liked a lot or maybe a team of such people that could be pretty satisfying
1, somehow i think the movie wouldn't have sold as well with that name

2,  yeah me too easily :)
0, are you saying that epistemic rationality ie striving to view the world accurately implies something like utilitarianism
1, small probability events given many chances to occur will occur; think of yourself as one member of a huge number of people in fact if enough people do this someone will get like 10 masterpieces in a row at some point
1," planning to continue being perverse and knowing mostly about category theory

tho if someone wants to pay me to read the entirety of both princeton companions i will"
3, i know your pain from both sides teacher and student because i was that student and am that teacher ha
2,  why yes yes it is
2, another sign that i am among my people

2, a self similar fractal of mushrooms
1, epistemic humility and getting feedback seem so important that if we were listing things in order of importance maybe they would need to go first 🙏
1, me too fr fr
6,maybe ea could have a better reputation if we could emphasize the diversity within ea more a big problem is that out-groups tend to be seen as being homogeneous so ppl hear things that sound extreme to them and then associate those with all of ea
3, i did this and it went well :)
4, it's using mathematical modeling to aid human judgment usually simple 2-3 term linear models with equal weights outperform human judges *if* the right variables get chosen to begin with i learned about it from my fav rationality book: https://tco/ojsdsy69kv
0,the approach that considers all of these and matches different combinations to the situation at hand is called critical systems thinking; that's my general mindset
6,i enjoy crunching numbers absurdly much; i never knew that about myself huh

(1) i like tweeting
(2) i have a hard time writing blog articles

possible solution: write thread copy to blog (&amp; prolly also linkedin); alternate writing in english and latin (obviously latin would not go to linkedin haha)"
2,7/ that's going to require a case command and is complicated enough to write an sql script in a separate file so we can fire up vim (or emacs) and type this in (saved afterward as salesquerysql): https://tco/wzzuoye5kd
1, woah ok
4,one time i said “i’ll solve these equations or go mad” and a mathematician sitting across from me starting rubbing her hands together and saying to the person sitting next to her “d’ya hear that she says she’ll go mad”

0,  😂
1, for u we need the box modal operator for necessity
0,8/ the reason for having these two measures is that we might not want a word to appear high on the list just because it gets used a lot everywhere; we can adjust how much each measure contributes to the ordering of words within topic areas

1,  yes there’s creepy bad and creepy good
1, i felt like i could be better at that too; i found a lot of what vanessa van edwards  says to be helpful
2,  i agree with what you're saying; as a practical matter whenever i've tried relaxing requirements it's led to really bad outcomes for me so i have the sense that my set of requirements is already the minimum viable set trying to just be happy now in the meantime
