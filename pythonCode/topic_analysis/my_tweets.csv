2,2022-12-04 23:24:46+00:00,3,Twitter Web App,"me: hey twitter, want the low down on a cool new ML approach?

twitter: hell yeah, but first can we throw axes at a moving target made of marshmallow?"
3,2022-12-04 23:02:06+00:00,0,Twitter Web App,9/ I've chosen to weight them equally for the above example; it's useful to play around with that parameter and see how it affects the results.
4,2022-12-04 23:02:05+00:00,0,Twitter Web App,8/ The reason for having these two measures is that we might not want a word to appear high on the list just because it gets used a lot everywhere; we can adjust how much each measure contributes to the ordering of words within topic areas.
5,2022-12-04 23:02:05+00:00,0,Twitter Web App,"7/ The analysis provides two different frequency measures for word occurences, one being the probability of a word appearing in a given topic area, and another (called ""lift"") that divides that probability by that word's overall frequency in the document."
6,2022-12-04 23:02:04+00:00,0,Twitter Web App,"6/ We see words like ""causes"" and ""huel"" showing up, but not words from another of my topic areas, ""systems thinking."" And realizing this, I might decide to try mixing these areas more when I talk about them if, e.g., I think that systems thinking might benefit EA causes."
7,2022-12-04 23:02:04+00:00,0,Twitter Web App,"5/ The analysis shown below is based off 3,000 of my tweets; they have been broken up into 10 topic areas. I've selected the one that most closely cooresponds to ""things having to do with EA."" https://t.co/rmgIXE3YBe"
8,2022-12-04 23:02:03+00:00,0,Twitter Web App,"4/ It could also reveal patterns in the ways I'm using words to discuss those topics. For example, maybe I use language that's too informal to talk about things on which I'd like to confer a bit more gravitas."
9,2022-12-04 23:02:02+00:00,0,Twitter Web App,"3/ For example, suppose I would like to maintain a certain balance between areas that I tweet about. LDA might reveal that I hardly ever talk about something I thought I tweeted about often, and as a result I might decide to tweet about that topic more often."
10,2022-12-04 23:02:02+00:00,0,Twitter Web App,2/ It can thus give a picture of what sorts of things are being written about as well as which words tend to be used together to talk about each thing; this knowledge can be useful for decision  making.
11,2022-12-04 23:02:01+00:00,0,Twitter Web App,1/ Topic analysis or Latent Dirichlet Allocation breaks a collection of documents (such as tweets) up into topic areas and calculates probabilities for words to appear both overall and within specific areas.
