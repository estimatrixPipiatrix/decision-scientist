So if we want to know what kinds of games we could count on most to bring reliable cash flow, these would be the ones, at least in North America."

514,2022-11-19 19:10:20+00:00,2,Twitter Web App,"6/ For that we can ask SQL to output a new column called ""Sales Category"", which will say ""Low Seller"" if less than 2 (of whatever units are being used) were sold ""Medium Seller"" if between 2 and 4 were sold, and ""High Seller"" if more than 4 were sold."
515,2022-11-19 19:10:19+00:00,2,Twitter Web App,"5/ If we only wanted to see, e.g., the Game, Genre, and ""North America"" columns, we would have typed ""select Game, Genre, ""North America"" from gameSales"", etc. Now suppose we want to see which games sold best in North America."
516,2022-11-19 19:10:19+00:00,2,Twitter Web App,"4/ The ""select *"" part tells SQL to extract data from all of the columns, but the ""limit 5"" part tells sql to show only the first 5 rows.
