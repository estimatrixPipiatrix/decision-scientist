0,i took y = sqrt(x) and added some gaussian noise to it; then i used polynomial regression with 7-fold cross-validation to get a best fit polynomial of degree 4 :) https://t.co/NQbwBrWRJF
1,saturday + home is such a safe space
2,  thanks! i got the congressive/aggressive distinction from here: https://t.co/rg5ZS8D0RW
3,"  it‚Äôs a good question; i dunno, but i wanna say it tends to be more of the congressive (we‚Äôll get thru this) than the aggressive (i‚Äôm gonna kick ur ass) variety."
4,  i love that the process involves conversion to vim keybindings
5, damn i want the answer to this question too
6,"i only got 4 responses, but here are the stats on them: the mean is 5'7"" w/standard deviation of 2.5 inches; my actual height is (drumroll) 5'8"" https://t.co/4zNFvkyNBf"
7,"or ""wow that chalkboard full of equations and diagrams is effing gorgeous"" or..."
8,"kinda sad that (at least in my experience) in science people rarely just stop for a bit and say ""wow that plot is effing gorgeous"""
9,"like, do i have to learn tableau?"
10,i know that AI can do it better but i'm soft and filled with warm goo
11,making pretty stuffs with matplotlib :) https://t.co/CPTDeEETlp
12,  a lot of the memes are EA poking fun at itself; as long as we aren‚Äôt ‚Äústicking it‚Äù to anyone it seems ok/good?
13,and ofc one way to be seen as diverse is to really be super diverse :)
14,"maybe EA could have a better reputation if we could emphasize the diversity within EA more. a big problem is that out-groups tend to be seen as being homogeneous, so ppl hear things that sound extreme to them and then associate those with all of EA..."
15, ah the beloved yellow springer books; omg u are making me want to do math all day
16,  i like this; also there's a feminine version of strength https://t.co/qnnky0TvpF
17, i‚Äôll tell the answer later
18, yeah i really screwed up that day; i‚Äôll never live it down
19,drowning my sorrows in code ü•≤

24,girl trying to find a way to make her epistemology involve solving the schr√∂dinger equation
25,hmm only 2 answers so far https://t.co/MXnMvSD1ok
26, i guess from the way ppl talk about me i‚Äôm doing ok; i sure try
27,also they like having the numbers and seeing what modeling of the data can do in the service of decision making
28,"e.g., my clients hear things like ""game-theoretic analysis"" and are like üòç"
29,re the freelancer thing: so far it sure seems better to try to find ur peeps and work with them than to strive toward having the widest appeal
30,6/ finally u can seek literal physical distance: go some place different than ur used to and think the decision thru there
31,5/ u can also get distance by looking at the decision through the lens of a second language
32,4/ ur current assumptions are like poker chips lying on a table in front of u. this way u are not your beliefs and evidence against one of them is not evidence attacking u personally
33,3/ u are hovering above everything looking down from the sky. it's a way of seeing yourself and everything else as part of a bigger picture
34,2/ the decision u need to make isn't yours but a friend of yours; this friend wants ur advice. the advice we give to others is often more rational than that we give to ourselves
35,"1/ distancing is often useful for thinking about a decision more rationally (see, e.g., https://t.co/zzO0eu3RbX ); to do it u can imagine that:"
36,or things that make u smile :)
37,i don't really wanna post engagement bait. i just wanna make a cozy little corner of twitter and try really hard to say useful things
38," oh goodness yes, statistics w/out causal models (usually obtained from subject area expertise) can be unhelpful or even misleading. i haven't read this one yet; i'll put it on my reading list :)"
39,"damn, understanding more about statistics is like having another sense..."
40,i have a friend who was once hustled out of her ice cream by a gang of ducks
41,"i enjoy crunching numbers absurdly much; i never knew that about myself, huh"
42,tell me how tall i am and i'll share some statistics on the answers
43, that's right: i've got a random number generator and ain't afraid to use it
44,yo: https://t.co/tCOfi1zWqe
45, don't worry i'll check it out and report back
46,"for some reason i imagine everything working this way, where the arrow means ""some amount of time later"":

47,i‚Äôm rolling 5 data frames deep y‚Äôall
48,"things are starting to get to me; i‚Äôve been forming addictive habits like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn"
49,  solving them old-school with special functions used to be my thing

54,"sometimes the nit that's being picked turns out to be not at nit at all but an important point, so there's also that..."
55,"""there is a sense in which Y"" can be weasely but can also deflect nitpickers; maybe we can have the deflecting w/out the weaseling by saying something like ""one useful way of thinking about X is Y"""

57,  i thought mario bros w/infinite lives ha
58, those wave functions are def up in each other‚Äôs business look away kiddies
59, it totally is! and i‚Äôm always attracted to those drow girls damn their amazing fashion sense :(
60, do as i wisp
61,so i went in for luv &amp; came out with an army of the undead
62, i want to say yes; ‚Äúwant‚Äù is the key word here
63,see i misheard &amp; thought necromancer was neck romancer
64," wow this one resonates, not that i‚Äôm difficult noooo no not even a little :|"
65, yaas
66,"to be me:
(1) have thought
(2) yes!
(3) on 2nd thought no
(4) but yes
(5) ok more complex 3rd thing but we are going w/yes as an approximation"
67, it hasn‚Äôt happened yet but i see the day coming
68, ah ok. darn.
69, i seem to be good at the opposite
70," the wave functions of the particles involved would overlap more and more, but i guess really i‚Äôd say the concept of touch is scale-dependent: it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me if we‚Äôre talking about a bunch of quantum fields"
71,"if someone QTs you rudely a bunch of times and then u block them, does ur stuff still show up in their QTs?"
72,  this is the enlightened view of cuddling that we need ‚ù§Ô∏è
73," the overlap is tiny, so while everything is touching, most things aren‚Äôt to a very good approximation, including butt/chair. gotta say this to ruin the party for everyone who likes to say entanglement therefore mystical stuffs yay"
74, i feel ur pain
75,put out that there are usually 4 or 5 alternate lenses thru which any one thing i say looks false
76," touch√©, or tooshie? and yes this is the view from the pinnacle of the jedi order"
77, things with nonzero ass often do attract one another‚Ä¶
78, yes that‚Äôs how we define it at the higher levels of jedi
79, ah okay - i was misunderstanding your point!
80,data munging... ok that sounds weird
81,  oh u can play video games. like solitaire and the one with a little wiggly snake thingy and... well actually that's it. those two.
82," this reminds me of a study where they looked at smoking incidence in doctors, and found that literally the further a doctor's specialty was from the lungs, the more likely it was that they would smoke"
83, u are making me reconsider my atomistic doctrine
84,  yes many ppl say that but here take some of our lovely brochures (i made them with LaTeX üòÅ)
85, fr fr
86, i guess it isn't clear to me that instrumental rationalism and effective altruism are the same thing. it does seem like the actions they lead to would typically have a lot of overlap...
87, hot take: ineffective rationalist = descartes
88,"nothing ever touches anything else: when u are sitting in a chair the atoms of your butt are just hovering above the atoms of the chair, which would be clear if you viewed the situation at an atomic scale"
89, how did u find the entrance to my lair?
90,ER: effective rationalism
91,anybody got a data set they'd like me to explore and tweet/blog about?
92," i guess from all my textbook experiences ""just a little pondering"" means i need to code something up or fill up only 1 or 2 sheets of paper with equations

also ""introduction"" seems to sometimes mean ""1800 page treatise"""
93, haha! maybe more like if u had a cat that just really wanted to speak latin
94,it‚Äôs hard to take risks when ur situation is comfortable; status quo bias looms heavy. i‚Äôve been handling this issue by doing multiple incremental experiments simultaneously and having (i hope) robust fallback plans
95, when the projects get more interesting i‚Äôll start tweeting/blogging about them
96," i like to get an idea what‚Äôs there first and start building those new neural connections: the things that recur a lot thru the text i‚Äôll remember; as for the rest, i‚Äôll remember what it does and where it is. i‚Äôm also doing mini projects for each chapter as i go"
97,i'm at pg 180 out of 515 of the python data science handbook üôè
98,"    even still, wow, they must be better at the language learning game than me‚Ä¶"
99," EA is kinda habit forming, not gonna lie. also a turn on."
100, that's just false advertising
101, yes but also me :)
102, glad to know it‚Äôs not only my mom who does that ha
103, like doing research to figure out how to save the most lives per dollar donated. it turns out that bed nets are really good for protecting ppl from malaria so giving bed nets has been one way
104,   i keep journals of my brain works; i look at stuff from 20 yrs ago and am like who the hell was that gee she seems smart
105, yes japanese because latin wouldn‚Äôt be weird at all :|
106, effective altruism; it‚Äôs a social movement for ppl who wanna help other ppl as effectively as possible
107, yay!! congratulations!!
108,yesterday i was telling my friend about EA and she was like ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a cult is it?‚Äù üòÖ

112,note to self on possible mad scientist schemes: drop the cockroach-controlled robots; go for lobsters instead
113,"  i was thinking similar things about the lobster and mouse, but felt very uncertain and voted dog to be safe ha. but lobster would only surprise me somewhat, strange to say: skinner showed that shaping + much less than human IQ can accomplish a lot of surprising feats"
114,  yeah i should‚Äôve worded that better
115,"  the kind of ppl i‚Äôm thinking of would just say ‚Äúi‚Äôm special because i happen to be me‚Äù 

and for goodness sakes some ppl don‚Äôt even value logical consistency: they could accept the premises but not the conclusion of a valid arg"
116,"  the sticky bit is that not everyone is bothered by the suffering of others, oy"
117,  utilitarianism afaik isn‚Äôt a meta-ethical position: it‚Äôs silent about the nature of moral pronouncements themselves. one can believe that goodness and badness don‚Äôt exist independently of valuing agents and still be utilitarian because personally one doesn‚Äôt like suffering
118,going in against a sicilian is low-key goated when death is on the line

165," if everyone is, e.g., anchored on something Yudkowsky said, this could be a problem üòÖ"
166, do you have a sense of the mean and spread among everyone's predictions? my thought is that averaging everyone should give a good estimate if the error is decorrelated
167,"  the Nothing could manifest itself physically and start destroying the Earth; you and I will just be like ""oh that again, hello familiar thing"""
168," not so far is all i can say. i've certainly gotten better at mindfulness and noticing. i think the problem might be the yawning chasm of Nothing that devours my soul, which i tend to notice a lot when i'm noticing things"
169, i have indeed; muchly!
170,"i want to lodge a complaint: my only tolerable moments these days are spent in flow state, where there's no time at all, and in some ways it's as if i didn't exist: i want to just sit here, be self-aware *and* be happy dammit (see i can do this if i'm being cuddled up real good)"
171,oh alright i‚Äôll get up
172,i wish i had a data set of everyone‚Äôs AGI timelines: i wanna know its statistical properties

242," i have mixed feelings. on some things they seem to be, e.g., trying to change anything systemically seems nigh impossible; at face value, 95% of scientists leaning left looks conformist; at the same time, there could be something on the right that's culturally driving that"
243," i'm an academic, sort of; fwiw, i suspected that it would go like this but wanted to hedge my bets, not just against twitter possibly failing but also (&amp; more likely) against the platform taking some direction i wouldn't like. so i have a mastodon too (and it's nice over there!)"

281," yes, everything we do has potentially unintended consequences. at the same time, it's a matter of degree: some moves are riskier than others. i used to think that we couldn't help what we believe, but lately it seems like it's possible to just make yourself believe things too"
282," like we could try to get ourselves to believe something because we think it might make future versions of ourselves happier, but that often has unintended consequences. so being careful what we believe seems in order, and that's what i mean by treading carefully"

548,   i know a girl who not only is down with that rationalist jive but also speaks latin and knows how to linux. she lives on a different continent tho dammit

561," yes, it happened in the course of bat-queen-ice-manning"
562, my digestive tract understands
563," as it happens, i have that flavor; gonna go for it"
564,i wonder what flavor of huel distracts from pain the most
565,ouch.
566,"ouch. ouch.

ouch."
567,  i'd run a topic analysis on these 100K+ answers ha
568,i somehow managed to cut two fingers simultaneously wtfarg
569,must... remain... conscious... long enough... to complain... on twitter
570,like srsly blood :-O
571,omg i've grievously papercut myself help
572, i'm biased because latin
573,some of u may be wondering how a person can be both an ice queen and batman at the same time: don't ask me i don't make the rules
574,also i'm batman :|
575,like sometimes i wonder if ppl srsly don't understand that bright lights hurt some of us
576,i'm super sensitive to bright lights; so to a world filled with white screens and fluorescent lights i say why god why
577, it could be a conspiratorial wink but if i really like u it could be flirting
578, i strongly suspect that i would love the work; i'll start pushing projects to github (and writing about them) within the next few weeks :)
579," i mean after many many status updates someone told me to ""get a twitter"" and that's how i ended up here :|"
580,  i am an ice queen
581,if i didn't care about ant suffering i'd go burn ants with my intense rays of weirdness to let off weird-steam right now
582,"me to my students: ""no self-respecting physicist would ever put the numbers in first before doing the algebra""

that's true, right?"
583, none of that fake analysis around here. we only do big-kid analysis
584,okay did it; now i need to write *another* really good sentence. more pacing
585,i need to write a really good sentence for a letter right now. not sure how to prepare for this. maybe pace back and forth a bit
586,"if i had a family, it'd be the strangest one ever: alright kids finish ur huel; then we'll code on the couch, check our social media, and work on strategic initiatives"
587,  damn that would mean i like the donald :-O
588, poaster? hadn't heard of that one. hmmmmm
589," i guess i'm mainly worried that twitter will turn into the kind of bar i don't like. u know, like where the bartender says ""hey u can't do math in here!"""
590, hovering in denial over here
591,"can't we just, u know, write our own fargin twitter app?"
592,waves of hunger breaking up on the cliff of not wanting to task switch
593,it seems mastodon got embarrassed about tooting (as opposed to tweeting) and has gone back to plain old posting
594,my brain isn‚Äôt transparent enough. can we get some AI peeps on that?
595," i will continue but only as fragments of shadow haunting the outskirts of mastodon, linkedin, and discord"
596,"i still kinda doubt the app will go down, but if it does i‚Äôll be super depressed because i luv u guyz"

600,"i don‚Äôt have experience in industry and that worries me. so far the idea is to overwhelm w/evidence of python, R, SQL, and decision sci badassery. damn i hope it works"
601, which industry is taking the hit?
602, i‚Äôll try it for sure: storytelling w/data is going to be important for what i wanna do

608, for u we need the box modal operator for necessity
609, mine not only has that but also eject :)

613," okay i can see two advantages of IDEs, but not necessarily Jupyter: there's often this nice debugger where u can step through lines of code, and there's a little window that shows all the variables currently being used along with their values"
614, i‚Äôm kinda wondering the same thing. right now it just looks like a fancy cheesecake
615, i was thinking to just push my working directory to github after every session...
616,usually i have two windows open: one for writing code and the other for running the code
617,i just like simplicity and feel weird programming inside a web browser. i'll do it if there's a good reason but otherwise maybe not
618,"is there some advantage to using jupyter notebook instead of just opening up a terminal and typing ""ipython""?"

624, psychological effects are important and are part of my utility calculation. maybe i just suck as a utilitarian but there it is
625," it doesn't seem quite logically equivalent to the trolley problem, but it can prolly be reformulated slightly to make it be. but it's not psychologically equivalent, and basically i won't do a thing if it would destroy me psychologically or turn me into darth vader"

631,my utility function contains things like ‚Äúfeeling like a monster for the rest of my life‚Äù and ‚Äúacting like a stabby person makes me more of a stabby person‚Äù
632,going to drown my sorrows in coffee and numpy
633,"crazy thought: using utilitarianism all by itself may not be the best idea, even if utilitarianism is correct"
634, i‚Äôve been storing this up; i now use it to power my house
635,ppl be like: ‚Äúwhat? i thought it was the trolley prob‚Äù
636,  also pissed about this
637,"i dunno how to put this but, u know, murder isn‚Äôt cool, man"
638, that makes sense. if twitter ever goes down i‚Äôll prolly start drooling and fall over
639, it sounds like motivated reasoning can be partially compensated for by seeking and taking feedback well?
640, yes plz
641,what‚Äôs worse: (1) scrutinizing very rigorously only the evidence u don‚Äôt like or (2) taking all evidence at face value w/not much vetting
642, i mean for me it would involve being defeated at galaga and somebody coding up something but otherwise yeah totally

659,the fact that i can post things about numpy and get likes is pretty based
660, getsizeof just doesn't return the right results for numpy objects so i used itemsize instead
661,  mostly an incorrigible ideological floozy but if u point a gun to my head i'll scream bayesian

667,"it seems like the adaptation level phenomenon and status quo bias can serve to make life more bearable, but i don‚Äôt care about life being bearable i want immortality, nanobot brain cells, and tentacles"
668, yeah i agree: mine seems to have put some peeps further out than they should be based on how much we interact
669, yeah that makes sense!
670, i don‚Äôt think getsizeof is giving all the memory that‚Äôs used: https://t.co/NKcAivyVZd
671,  thanks üòä
672,apparently when u store an integer in a list it takes up a crapton more memory than storing it in a numpy array; that is partly why numpy is faster than using lists

686," i want to reek of R, python, and SQL to such an extent that no one can stand near me"
687, i think the idea is that BIG DATA is going to be stored somewhere and to access this BIG DATA i‚Äôm going to need SQL; so to get stinking good at SQL i can use it even locally
688, interesting! i luv grep so i guess i‚Äôm about to find out
689,my butt is not pointy i have checked. but wherever i sit down it damages the furniture. i must conclude that my butt becomes pointy when i sit

693, omg that sounds based
694,so i'm guessing that i can just start storing all my data in SQL tables and pulling it out with something like dbplyr...
695,"i kinda think i would enjoy sitting in a dim room, analyzing the hell out of data, and writing recommendations based on the results; that's a thing, right? they could just slide coffee under the door and check to see if i'm alive from time to time"

705, one of my superpowers is unraveling incomprehensible articles; the other is being able to sound like a baby alligator. hoping that one of these will come in useful for my next career
706, some proportion of peeps literally have no conscience; some proportion of those enjoy hurting others. at the same time people do the best they can w/what they have. i guess i‚Äôm the type of good guy that blows up the death star but feels bad about it
707, i find that thinking real hard followed by sleep generally helps. it‚Äôs like yelling help so loud to ur brain that it keeps working even tho u r asleep; that followed by consolidation in the morning is huge
708,  Daly are u running Qualy‚Äôs account again?

715," thanks! i‚Äôll check some of these out, esp the ML thru a probabilistic approach. i luv probability theory"

754,"omg SQL is easy y'all (famous last words)

but yeah so far it seems super easy"

765, yes! putting it on my list :)
766, what leads u to think that it's only that?
767,"having so-called ""bright line"" rules helps me a lot. there's no weaseling out of whatever it is: i either stay on the right side of that glowing line in the sand or not

768,cognitive dissonance threat for the forces of good
769,"just saying things to myself like ""i'm a person who doesn't eat sugar"", etc, seems so powerful"

774,failure mode: running out of coffee
775,"if u guyz see any likely failure modes for me, plz let me know! the plan is to do &amp; write about decision making related projects using R, python, and SQL until near the end of spring; then start applying to positions as a decision scientist (&amp; whatever else seems to fit)"
776,"having thought about this more, i feel less certain. the development projects i've been in involved fortran code that was badly written, w/out even having version control. that and my own fortran code, where i tried to do too much for one person"

781, thanks for the tip! :)
782, i do still have that ha
783,"""applying to what?"" is the last thing. i'm not sure but i think those positions are just called ""decision scientist""; i can poke around on https://t.co/a3o1eR4HFN and other things later today to find out more. now maybe my brain will let me sleep"
784,"i already know how to do statistical analysis and ML in R, and i've written a good bit before in python using numpy and matplotlib, so the python part can't be that hard. SQL will be new. i'm thinking six months should be enough to prepare before i would start applying to things?"
785,"these things i should do with a focus on ML, and that with a continued focus on improving thinking, e.g., by integrating these ideas with systems thinking, judgment and decision theory: that nexus is where i want to be"
786,"i can't sleep, but while not being able to sleep i realized a couple of things: first, i should just code stuff up in R *and* python because that gives me the greatest flexibility to do whatever i want; second, i ought to learn SQL so i can deal with larger amounts of data"
787, When would you need it done by? I have in fact been practicing with github lately and would like to get better with it!
788, Thanks!
789, it‚Äôs also true: i‚Äôve been trying to figure out if I should switch to something else but R is so cozy

808,"i can't help but think that chocolate might improve this situation, if i had any"
809,at least i enjoy spending my time on ML and systems thinking. there's that
810,"i guess the hardest part about spending 100s or 1000s of hours upskilling is that, in the end, it's an investment that comes with risks. the decision tree might say that doing it makes sense, but it's hard to shake that feeling of doubt"
811,"and there is such a thing as decision support analyst, haven‚Äôt forgotten about that. just not a lot of it out there it seems"
812,i‚Äôm still into the AI alignment idea but worried mightily about funding

833,in fact the more suits are present the more ripped jeans tank top i go
834,i never dress formally for anything even when i‚Äôm super supposed to
835,"i used to think that evil didn‚Äôt get out of bed before around 10, but then i realized no that‚Äôs me"
836, damn i need my lawyer for this
837, tbh that‚Äôs what i do üòÖ
838,i'm .pt and if y'all put ur mastodon addresses i'll follow u there!
839, i think i might be too
840,"I realized this morning that, while I love to do high level coding, using things other people wrote, I don't want to be a programmer in a big coding project: I'd much rather work with programmers and use ML than be a programmer and make ML software"
841, hug received! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
842, i luv u too Rayne ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
843, that was awesome üòå
844, Is there a book that derives rule utilitarianism from axioms? If it uses formal logic that'd be even better
845, thank you ü•≤
846,and one more thing: i feel sad someone plz hug me
847,"i'm not sure but it seems like a lot of bad in the world comes from being too willing to say that other people are bad, which is ironic if true"
848,5/ All I need to do is try to approximate my ideal self. Okay now everyone can start throwing coconut cream pies at me
849,"4/ The utilitarian perspective has been the most useful of the three for me; one explanation for that is that it's more correct than the others (maybe my ideal self would just do that all time), but I don't feel like I need to take a position on it?"
850,"3/ I know that I can't be in this ideal state, but I can aspire toward it by trying to see a situation from as many perspectives as possible. So (among other things) I put on virtue, deontological, and utilitarian ""hats"" to see what each says about a situation"
851,"2/ My metaethics is thus a combo of emotivism and ideal observer theory: It seems to me that I want to do what I would want to do if I were in a certain ideal position, i.e., understanding all the relevant facts, including how it would feel to be others affected by my actions"
852,"1/ I'm gonna say what I think about ethics for a bit. I'm not highly confident about any of it; it's just what so far makes the most sense to me. First, I don't see how objective values could exist in the world: I'm a physicalist; it seems like, e.g., everything is quantum fields"
853, i guess two outta three ain‚Äôt bad
854," first, get into a game of chicken. then detach the steering wheel and throw it out the window while in clear view of the opposing driver (insane signal). then after they swerve, pick up the spare steering wheel that you brought with you and attach it (dependably competent)"
855, but i am traveling near the speed of light right now
856, ok all i need to do is be where u are and i can get so much more stuff done
857, a million dollars would add quite a bit of value to my life
858,it cannot be 8:30 already i object
859, pretty good summary
860,"according to the things i‚Äôve seen being written about EA this week, i am deeply evil and stupid; yes, those are my two defining traits as y‚Äôall know :|"
861, i guess that would make elon thanos. yeah seems kinda right
862,c'mon i know u want to

869, yeah julia seems amazing
870, that's beautiful!
871, oh cool! fauxpilot - sounds like just my speed ha ha; thanks :)
872, that looks cool but not free? i don't want to give up my avocado toast :|
873,considering just using reticulate to do all the python stuff from within R. i'm so addicted to R
874," oh okay, yes this looks better than using csv.reader, thanks!"
875,"after learning how to read a csv file into python, i feel spoiled by R. in R u get this beautiful data frame by typing just one command: read.csv; in python it doesn't seem that nice?"
876,also using models can help with not adjusting enough
877,"as far as i can tell, the best balance between these extremes is to get good at detaching from beliefs as well as at paradigm jumping"
878,"there's anchoring, i.e., starting with a bad prior and/or not adjusting it enough in light of new evidence...

and then there's refusing to learn something that could be valuable due to fear of anchoring"
879,a way to maximize the advantages of both kinds of view is to have an outsider come in and learn before evaluating
880,also by bad EA critiques
881,inspired by a certain person coming in and apparently firing all the insiders that would be most knowledgeable
882,"it's understandable to value outside views, but inside views can be valuable in ways outside views can't be, precisely because they are informed by what's been going on inside"
883," a therapist, a mathematician, a musician"
884,"i‚Äôve written 1000s of lines of fortran 90, but i wouldn‚Äôt wanna even be tested on that!"
885,"like if someone wants a random forest model i totally can do that, but not w/out looking stuff up"
886,i‚Äôm kind of afraid of ever being subjected to a coding interview. i just look stuff up all the time; what i remember is a function of what came up last :/
887,If anyone here wants to connect with me on LinkedIn: https://t.co/sV8CNh3PpQ
888, done!

949, something interesting will happen soon-ish
950,   i exempt myself by being an *extra mathy* physicist
951, it's ok: i called the local chapter of the american mathematical association; they sent in a squad who solved it with epsilon-delta notation
952, yes and the problem love bombed me and i fell for it and then the problem moved in and holy hell

1130, haha! once someone saw that i was reading classical mechanics and thought i was studying to work on cars
1131, aww ü•∞
1132,it‚Äôs so interesting revisiting the ML methods in my analytics book while reading about AI alignment: i seem to really get a sense from the former about what‚Äôs going on w/the latter
1133, where did u find my old year book pic
1134, aw shucks
1135, yeah
1136, feeling like this could be good
1137, it‚Äôs reliable: i trained it on tons of nymph and dwarf data. for some reason it will repeatedly tell u to invest in the glass slipper market; just ignore that
1138,my tweets are absolute bangers to 0.7 people on avg; ur welcome
1139,one time my friends shamed me out of using Arch Linux: wut u think ur better than us
1140,  this is me: i‚Äôm batman

1144,going to taylor expand myself and truncate everything after the 0th order approximation
1145,one time a guy asked me why i was doing that; i asked him why he did anything he did
1146,"""no i will not; leave me alone i'm integrating by parts"""
1147,"when i was a teenager there was no one like me around, so i hung out with whoever was willing. it led to me sitting in the eye of a hurricane of drugs and sex studying a calculus book"

1152, it's using mathematical modeling to aid human judgment. usually simple 2-3 term linear models with equal weights outperform human judges *if* the right variables get chosen to begin with. i learned about it from my fav rationality book: https://t.co/oJSDsy69kv

1156, and i thought going to https://t.co/r3AJ9YtgpH was clever
1157,"like i go downtown and people be like: ""belief calibration something something fiber bundle Linux thingie"""
1158, i dunno but i put out an ad on Fiverr for the position

1161,if # times u have sex per week - # fights u have per week &gt; 0 then u are in a happy relationship
1162,now all i have to do is tweet a banger
1163,"if i tweet a banger and there is no one around to see it... it's still a banger, yaas"
1164, srsly this is no yolk
1165,what twitter is to me is a bunch of networks of people helping each other
1166,when u remember that u know how to make things other than grilled cheese sandwiches
1167,oh why am i me?

1171, the real reason i am trying it out
1172, bad urth
1173,time is the issue here
1174,i have a million pages of stuff to read and a million more. gods help me
1175,i love the idea of generalized additive models btw
1176,"i‚Äôm reading this book and thinking ‚Äúdamn, everyone in ML needs to know this stuff‚Äù"
1177,to what extent are ML practitioners already aware of the kinds of issues raised in The Alignment Problem?
1178," that's the thing: no matter what happens to everyone else, the one person who will be with you until the end is you. another reason i try to be nice to me"
1179," my parents took me on a cruise with them once and they felt that i didn't give them their $'s worth, because i just sat in my room and ate room service sandwiches the whole time. i was like ""this is effing great: u order a sandwich and they bring it to u!!"""
1180," i decided that i need to get better at this too. so i set up a lemonade stand dealy on the side of the road and wrote ""decision support, $2"" on the front"
1181, i prefer argument by entomology
1182, oh just gimme my damn fries. and don't call me ma'am
1183,me trying to explain to the ancient romans why u can't fight a squadron of elephants with a squadron of flaming pigs because lighting pigs on fire is bad
1184,don't bother me with details like explosives not having been invented yet
1185,"see what the trojans should've done is gone ahead and put the horse inside the city walls, but then filled the city with explosives, vacated it, and waited for the greeks to enter before detonating"
1186,and combine w/reading more of The Alignment Problem
1187,"gonna start re-reading my business analytics book today, that's what"
1188," pretty sure, yeah. funny thing is, i find myself in the future just walking places. like if i go to the kitchen right now i'll end up like 5 seconds into the future. scary shit. i'm not going anywhere ever again"
1189,"dean walks by and catches me trying to dig a hole in the wall with a teaspoon: ""hey what the hell are u doing?""

me: ""um nothing. nothing just an, um, experiment!"""
1190,"  i'm into that shit, and i will bite u"
1191,  haha excellent
1192," that def sounds worth considering, thanks!"

1199," i had a gf for 13 yrs (still friends with) who was the first and so far last who was a good fit for me. i didn‚Äôt know she liked me for a couple of months after we met. the day she let me know was the best day i‚Äôve had; 10 years after that were the best years.

how about u?"
1200, not sure how integratedly the subjects are taught but it looks pretty good just reading the website!
1201, ...to get to know you better :)
1202," it did occur to me; it seemed like it might not be a good fit for a couple of reasons: first it seems to entail a lot of traveling (i hate flying); second, there's not so much research, writing, or ML involved? but i really like those things"
1203,but if i did work at dunkin donuts i wouldn‚Äôt have to grade papers
1204,  which is literally here https://t.co/r3AJ9YtgpH
1205,just gonna imagine really hard that i've got someone to cuddle with. i need a cuddling support analyst
1206," damn, i guess there is no escaping DD"
1207,  is damned smart. this i determined from talking to her ha
1208,"4/ of course i could also stop freelancing and just work for an org directly. an EA org would be awesome, but i suppose it doesn't have to be. it also seems like it could be viable as remote work, though again it wouldn't have to be"
1209,3/ though all that is expensive and so i wouldn't expect the average guy on the street to be able to afford it. which means i should be pitching toward... high level decision makers in orgs
1210,"2/ what i prolly should be doing is collecting info, doing research on the issues at stake, including analyzing or running ML on any relevant data sets, and writing a report recommending viable courses of action"
1211,"1/ given this latest insight about what sort of person i am/want to be, it looks like what i've been doing with clients has been weighted too much toward the counseling side of things"
1212,"and months ago i wrote a list of what i value most, another of what i'm good at, and then looked through a gagillion job ads looking for overlap; things like decision scientist kept coming up"
1213,like i took this long questionnaire just now over at CareerExplorer (https://t.co/mqn5KAYLjr) and the top careers came up as data scientist and psychologist
1214,"every which way i figure it, the right job for me seems to be a cross between some sort of data scientist and a counselor; still looks like decision support analyst to me"
1215,any tips for someone who would like to fly like superman by locally distorting spacetime?
1216,apologies for being more negative than usual lately
1217,when i need irl interaction but all i‚Äôve got is twitter https://t.co/1BT3ekhbOj
1218,"w/out caffeine and chocolate, my IQ must be like 20 points lower üòÖ"
1219,"w/out a pen and piece of paper, my IQ must be like 20 points lower üòÖ"
1220,"just in case u were curious, mastodon is very similar to twitter. if we were all over there, i think it'd pretty much be like it is here"
1221," makes sense. mastodon is a strange land where, instead of tweeting, they toot; instead of giving little hearts, they give stars"
1222," it's highly likely that twitter will be fine, but i like to hedge my bets"
1223,https://t.co/vQb4RV53fT
1224, what book are y‚Äôall using?
1225, Etiam de hƒÅc rƒì n≈çn pr≈ç cert≈ç mƒì habe≈ç üòÖ
1226,and by that i mean ‚Äúi hate grading papers‚Äù
1227,i don't understand anything
1228,this planet is a hostile environment where ionizing radiation rains down from the sky every day
1229,i want nighttime savings
1230,"ok y'all, i have a mastodon handle: .pt"
1231, yaas!
1232,"   when i think about it, maybe it's not quite true: like if i were helping one person i liked a lot or maybe a team of such people, that could be pretty satisfying"
1233,"   i think i'd find a job like that tolerable. it sounds kind of like my present job but w/out the terrible aspects (teaching, grading). ideally i'd want something at least potentially highly impactful"
1234,   like right now i'm supposed to be grading papers and omg i'd almost rather die
1235,   i have a hard time doing repetitive tasks. if i'm not embroiled in some kind of thing to unravel i'm not happy
1236, i don't want to disparage NJ: it's one of the best states i've lived in. i just need to move on. maybe too much bad stuff happened to me out here
1237,   i think you totally got it! i seem to need a lot :(
1238,   that's a very good point. i think i'm just afraid that if i were to do most ordinary jobs i would sustain continous psychic damage until i died :(
1239,do you feel ok about your current job?
1240," yeah i was kinda hoping to have swashbuckling space adventures and die of wounds from a sword fight somewhere in the galactic core, but that's maybe a big ask"
1241, thank you üôè
1242,"someone plz tell me that i will escape New Jersey and academia, and that i won't end up working at dunkin donuts"
1243," if you have an idea what your chances of success are in applying to an internship, maybe a decision tree would help?"
1244, i applied to it :)
1245, i approve of this question
1246,we need a rat mastodon server :|
1247,"if i have to bail out of twitter for whatever reason, maybe i'll just wander the EA forum playing guitar for tips"
1248,"so what is the schelling point for tpot anyway? u know, just hypothetically if we needed to find each other elsewhere"
1249,what‚Äôs this stuff about twitter possibly shutting down? did i miss a memo?
1250, i‚Äôm actually a zombie and eat evil brains https://t.co/U9i4ubaEp4
1251, roger that
1252,i‚Äôm gonna go out there. like outside. wish me luck
1253, i will appreciate not being in any physical pain
1254, u have to beat me at galaga
1255,why does nearly every job sound like this to me: ‚Äúperson needed to do super specific meaningless thing - really something that won‚Äôt help the world in any way whatsoever; 5 yrs prior experience preferred‚Äù
1256," i live on the outskirts of nyc, only going in to fight crime at night; it‚Äôs a pretty good city. challenging bad guys, good bibimbop"
1257, that‚Äôs a latte of money
1258,"  i‚Äôve also been told that it isn‚Äôt dumb but just hopeless unless you‚Äôre a super genius‚Ä¶ which could be true; again, gotta have enough courage to devote time to figure it out for myself"
1259,"  there‚Äôs a lot to learn going in; meanwhile people tell you it‚Äôs dumb, so it takes some resisting social pressure and enough nerve to just think through the issues for oneself"
1260,"i feel like, socially, saying u can do this is taken the same way as declaring oneself to be a genius üòÖ"
1261, ü§£
1262,"is there any way to market being able to learn anything, move between fields effortlessly, and synthesize knowledge across those domains? or does the world just firmly believe such a person can‚Äôt exist"
1263, these are lovely
1264,  it seems like i‚Äôll just have to keep reading and thinking about it. on controversial issues it often seems people state wildly opposing views with equal and absolute confidence. i‚Äôm going to try hard to go at this like i imagine julia galef would
1265," i like this definition, because it implies that i don‚Äôt overthink even tho i‚Äôm running my brain on wide open all the time üòÖ"
1266,walking down the street thinking ‚Äúyeah i could cuddle w/that person‚Äù
1267,i have an almost unlimited capacity to absorb information. like i can literally read books/articles all day
1268,i‚Äôm still a cheez ball. just an increasingly somber one
1269, it would me too üôè
1270,getting so caught up in the formalization of a problem that the goal is forgotten = mathturbation
1271,"in the limit of increasing complexity, a model would reproduce reality itself, with the same lack of understanding that led us to modeling in the first place"
1272, sorry to hear; i worry about this too as i start going out on a limb more
1273,"u know, even if all hard decision making could be automated away tomorrow, i would still want hard things to think about"
1274,there is an inverse relationship between complexity of a model and understanding it can convey
1275,"for example, a decision support ML algorithm based on cover letter/resume wording of past successful applicants can encode pernicious biases from past hiring, while just scoring based on a few well-chosen metrics might help avoid the issue"
1276,i‚Äôm saying this as someone who loves ML btw
1277,trying to use statistics without some underlying causal model seems to lead to tons of problems. using a 3 factor linear model can be better than using an ML one with 50 parameters
1278," fair enough. if i make my career be about ‚Äúthe‚Äù alignment problem, i will be balancing between prob, risk, and the likelihood of my being able to meaningfully contribute when choosing which aspects to focus on"
1279," not sure what i think about the x-risk aspect. i can say that a really bad thing, even with a very small probability, seems worth thinking about: negligence = probability*risk"
1280,and i would include more than bio/chem/phys and not even limit to the sciences: artificial domain boundaries are not just out of date but increasingly harmful
1281,"learning institutions should have degree programs in integrative science, in which biology/chemistry/physics are taught together, not like Neapolitan ice cream flavors, but by showcasing how they are inextricably tangled up in the real-world‚Äôs pressing problems"
1282,"which is unfortunate, because knowledge transfer across disciplines is part of the key to solving the world‚Äôs big problems"
1283,"in society‚Äôs insistence on specialization, the idea of transdisciplinarity itself as a discipline often goes unnoticed"
1284," i‚Äôm reading ‚Äúthe alignment problem‚Äù and only 30 pg in it‚Äôs pretty clear that there are major issues, e.g., test data not representing minorities enough leading to AI-based decision support software (for example one having to do w/whether to grant parole!) being racist/sexist, etc"
1285,i have an active passport again yay!
1286,"  well, getting killed by category theory is one way of solving all my problems"
1287,"  3/ but even when there is only one person who is doing the thinking, it's possible to simulate a variety of perspectives via these approaches and come up with many ideas that one would have been unlikely to arrive at otherwise. end elevator pitch."
1288,  2/ the approaches for dealing with social complexity deal with multiple players with different worldviews and have (partly) the goal of harnessing the knowledge of all who are involved with maximum effectiveness
1289,"  1/ different systems thinking approaches arise from different paradigms and are good for handling different kinds of complexity: structural, organizational, social, etc; adopting the appropriate paradigms and combinations of methods is a powerful thinking tool"
1290, i sorta suspect it‚Äôs the right way to think about everything üòÖ
1291,Link - man + woman ‚âà Samus maybe
1292," i haven‚Äôt, so looking forward to it :)"
1293,but Link - man + woman ‚â† Zelda dammit
1294, i got revenge on my rebellious teenage kids by not having them
1295," u know my brother‚Äôs name is David haha. i‚Äôll have a look, thanks!"
1296, can you recommend something good to read?
1297,words-as-vectors is a nifty idea
1298, how critical systems thinking can be used to improve thinking: Critical Systems Thinking and the Management of Complexity https://t.co/BhNIAP0z6J
1299, i found this book helpful: Secrets of Mental Math: The Mathemagician's Guide to Lightning Calculation and Amazing Math Tricks https://t.co/EQFh6EYR8x
1300," also there are just really good textbooks on QML, like this one: Modal Logic for Philosophers https://t.co/f6VORtgopS"
1301," i found it super interesting to study arguments for and against the existence of god using quantified modal logics, like here: Logic and Theism: Arguments for and against Beliefs in God https://t.co/0haIBvIzWB"
1302," yes; i enjoyed that book very much! i only wished that had written about quantified logics too, but i understand why he didn‚Äôt do that"
1303, yes i‚Äôve done that. and my brains ha
1304, when i read these things i don‚Äôt think ‚Äúdesperation‚Äù. i think ‚Äúwow lots of people seem to have similar experiences as me on those apps‚Äù and feel kinda less weird
1305, max galaga score
1306, Hi back fellow food stuff :)
1307, i am Huel :-|
1308,  sounds like the concept of infectious dose applied to apples
1309,  it sounds bad i guess because usually things are expressed non-dimensionally such that 1 would not be considered a perturbation anymore: we expect that the terms get smaller and smaller because increasing powers of numbers less than 1 do that‚Ä¶
1310, it‚Äôs spidaman: get‚Äôem!
1311,   or weltanschauung if u like german
1312,   i feel like worldview is more neutral with approx the same content?
1313, woah! ok
1314, pretty badass - did he somehow possess ghost rider and wolverine?
1315, it saves gas not to commute
1316,the reason is that this type of logic is really useful in philosophy. ok i‚Äôll stop ranting about my crazy life history now
1317,"i love non-classical logics and proof systems, esp quantified modal logics"
1318,"i didn‚Äôt even mention that whole formal logic odyssey that went on in parallel with all this,  mathematically modeling natural language and natural language arguments"
1319, Mathematical Physics: A Modern Introduction to Its Foundations https://t.co/aZvNmRjP6k
1320,"now i want to work on something that actually matters. i‚Äôve spent almost my whole life thinking anout how to use the power of mathematics to think about anything, everything"
1321,"my path seems logical but has led me to a weird place, weirder than the sunless depths of the ocean where my studies started, and far away from there"
1322,"it also led me to applied category theory and non-mathematical systems thinking, which i‚Äôve been learning the last couple of years and trying to integrate into one thing, a mathematical system of systems thought"
1323,but many important real world problems are not best thought of as systems of differential equations; i started to read widely over mathematics and theoretical physics to extend the kinds of systems i could handle. it led me to that ginormous now leather-bound book i posted about
1324,"after that i did a lot of ‚Äúanalytic‚Äù work, solving differential equations by hand; that became my shtik: https://t.co/8jLIl9jbX7"
1325,i did get some publications out of it i‚Äôm happy to say: https://t.co/pEbXLafoN6
1326,also implementing the thermodynamic equations of state for NaCl-H20 was‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ not easy
1327,i haven‚Äôt worked on it in a long time. i got really burnt out on being the sole developer for it and not having adequate institutional support for that kind of thing
1328,"so i had written a big fortran 90 code for simulating multi-phase flow of salt water in fractured rock: https://t.co/LPtRegbZwk

originally i wrote every single bit of code but later switched out my gradient descent solver for a minimized least residual solver"
1329," u know it‚Äôs high chic to wear 2 low items with 1 high (or something), so i say ratio it 2:1 (or something)"
1330," it starts off sounding like it‚Äôs about me: 7th grader gets bullied, hides in library, gets locked in, reads 2000 pg treatise on formal logic. my formative years here"
1331, a series of calculations; a feeling that brings tears to my eyes with love for humanity; a series of calculations that brings tears to my eyes because i've run out of paper
1332,"ok everybody, here we go https://t.co/JcA0SIHRM2"
1333," that‚Äôs what i am among my peoples, who know what rationality is üòÖ"
1334, that‚Äôs so hitchhiker‚Äôs guide to the galaxy üíó
1335, that sounds really nice
1336," 2/ creative: i tend to make images of concepts and situations to help me understand them; they tend to be multi media or digital :)

self-love: latin, math, exercise, making controlled failures, viewing failure as learning, kind self-talk"
1337," 1/ emotional: i seem really good at knowing what i'm feeling and being able to communicate that. i love warm data (re how people feel) and understanding others

relating: i learned a lot from vanessa van edwards over at science of people and read/think a lot about this"
1338, human decisions
1339, the mean of this gaussian confirms my suspicions :|
1340,"also analyst suggests to me ""analytics,"" which is part of what i do"
1341,"i think i might just start saying i'm a decision support analyst rather than decision advisor, because the former is in-use already in the business sector"
1342, i'll do my best! i would love to be over there too ‚ô•Ô∏è
1343,"so: moving forward learning about the alignment problem. sticking with the idea of ""decision support analyst"" for the time being"
1344,i need to learn a lot more about the alignment problem before i can decide how that might fit in. the larger project for me seems to be imagining what i might look like in an EA org given mostly the skills i already have
1345, how come not Europe? though i did decide to drop that as a requirement
1346,"i think my current skillset looks like: ""decision support analyst"" using systems thinking, ML, and typical tools from judgment and decision theory

+ holy crapton of math not sure how that fits in just yet"
1347," details, details‚Ä¶"
1348,"call yourself a decision advisor and life be like: ""so you think ur good at making decisions do u bwahahahaha"""
1349,please wait: large bayesian updates loading‚Ä¶
1350, I have a lot to think about.
1351," AI alignment, I should have said; I'll take all the help I can get btw"
1352,"  i'm not sure what u are talking about, but it's true that i have no cleavage and am semi-dangerous"
1353," you could replace ""runs"" with pretty much any word and i would still agree. i guess ""coffee"" might not work"
1354,  still trying to figure out how to make queal puns
1355," I'm in an academic teaching contract until spring semester is over. It might be possible to break it, but currently I'm thinking to stuff myself with AI knowledge and apply like a crazy person nearer to that time"
1356, I just want to make sure that I won't be missing anything important that would come up in job interviews
1357, I did already have this thread: https://t.co/jzoyskX6n7
1358,"if you are an AI alignment researcher and are willing to help me wade into this area, please DM"
1359,i found this yummy treat: https://t.co/C3w62DKd3L
1360,gonna document my progress into AI here. u guyz should go get your popcorn
1361," oh cool! okay i've heard of lambda calculus so i've just got to remind myself about it, etc, i'll revisit your question after that"
1362,i understand the mathematical basis of those algorithms as well as for neural nets
1363, what is a lambda in this context? (i've got a ton of reading to do and i suspect this to be symptomatic of that)
1364," i'm not sure i understand the goal-space model. is ""goal"" just a utility function over the domain possible worlds?"
1365,"if i want to do alignment research, how important is it to be really good at python? so far i've just been running ML algorithms in R"
1366," I haven't, but I requested a call with them"
1367, did I understand what you were asking correctly?
1368," that seems like a really good question; i would think that firstly we should try to lower the probability that people using AI with good intentions would accidentally cause global-scale catastrophe; at the same time, it's def important to consider people using AI with bad intent"
1369, I hadn't heard of the Yak Collective; it looks interesting!
1370," I don't want to continue modeling subseafloor fluid flow is part of the issue. If it's possible for me to work on making AI safer, I really would love to work on that! Failing that, something like green energy could make sense. I do have some background in ethics btw :)"
1371, i too am a funny guy
1372, and once again the secret to being a better person is emulating julia galef
1373, ...or as i'm afraid that it might be
1374,"i had just been convinced that all this math/physics i know was only going to be useful in academia: yet another instance of thinking that everyone knows what i know, or that if i know something other people don't then it's useless anyway

clearly i gotta quit doing that üòÖ"
1375," depending on what happens, that might be tremendously helpful, thanks!!"
1376,also dropping the requirement of it being remote or living  in Europe. anywhere is okay: what's most important is that i'm doing work that is meaningful to me
1377, and my teaching load is lighter in the spring than in the fall
1378, i love learning complex stuff: that's my element :)
1379,"alright, new plan; please let me know if there's anything obviously wrong with it: i'm going to start applying to jobs involving AI alignment; if it turns out there are things i need to know that i don't currently know, then i can spend the next several months learning them"
1380, gods i hope not because i‚Äôm about to throw myself at it
1381," Wow, that's great to know! I'll try :)"
1382," if i spent another year where i am and just studied the heck out of AI alignment, do you think getting a position working on that could be plausible?"
1383," i thought you were gonna say ""least favourite X-men"" üòÖ"
1384," i am indeed interested in it! i just figured that, not being an AI engineer, i‚Äôd have too much realistically to learn and also might lack convincing credentials"
1385, this could be a partial solution! maybe i could tutor on the side of whatever else i‚Äôm doing

1400," also, i worked through this whole book this past summer and really enjoyed it: https://t.co/FFISNiYPCx"
1401," in reading about hard systems thinking,  it was clear that trying to apply math to everything led to too narrow a range of problems irl being addressible, so i spent a great deal of time learning about systems thinking, the kind of thing consultants run around using, so that too?"
1402, i've gotten to a weird place where 90% of the time i don't even understand pizza anymore
1403," in my research i've been studying mostly seafloor hydrothermal systems, but i'm not passionate about that per se, even though it does have the ""cool"" factor"
1404," i know a ton about differential equations, group theory, differentiable manifolds, and other areas of mathematical physics. i love that whole language and am good at applying it to disparate things outside trad physics, so mathematical modeling? does that count as object level?"
1405,  i knew it
1406,  i applied to the EA dominatrix posting on the 80000 hrs job board
1407,"  that made me laugh, thank you fr"

- is at the same time very introverted and needs a lot of time alone"
1411,"2/ who:

- can abstract the essence of a technique from almost any area, see all the uses it can be mapped to, and apply it in those other areas, but who

- doesn't care to ""be great"" by publishing original research, especially if it isn't helping anyone in a tangible way"
1412,"1/ so what does someone do, for a living, who: 

- can unravel anything, no matter how many equations it has, amost no matter how badly written it may be, and explain it to almost anyone, but who

- is unwilling to teach even one person who is there to check a box"
1413, i just have a very odd combination of talents/wants. maybe i should write a thread about it just to get it out of me; maybe it would help me to think more clearly about what is clearly an issue for me and always has been
1414,"  i have been drawn here like iron filings to a magnet, and am resigned to while away the rest of my time on this earth tweeting out banger after banger"
1415, that sounds plausible; i just wish people would throw pennies at me and make wishes or something. being able to pay the rent w/said pennies would also help
1416,seriously this thought makes me cry y'all. damn

(2) strong technical ability
(3) knows game theory and can plausibly convince others of being cray cray"
1463,i feel like i'd be a good super villain except for the fact that i'm not evil and stuff (just going through career options again)

1530," Yeah, though it's useful to know what kinds of contracts I could take!"

1541, Russ Ackoff had this system where each manager would have her own personal board of advisors; these advisors would come from both lower and higher levels in the org. Maybe a similar structure would help to keep small teams current.

1604," my only criterion there is that it's somewhere in Europe where they don't speak English, so not UK

spain is game, portugal is game, germany is game, etc"
1605," It wouldn't have to use all of these, but decision making and technical ability would need to somehow be involved"
1606," I don't currently have a visa for anywhere, so that could indeed be tricky. I def want something that would use my skills: decision making, ability to read, synthesize, and explain in a non-technical way highly technical subject matter, great people skills, &amp; ML"
1607,"if i were to invest about 4 hrs/day looking for/applying for jobs that use my abilities and would allow/require me to live in Europe, how long would it take me to get hired somewhere?"

(1) bite the bullet: all hail the utility monster
(2) destroy the damn thing"
2005,"Welp, at least I'm not afraid to ask the dumb question.

My quantum mechanics prof once turned to me and asked ""Do you understand ANYTHING?""

Otoh I was one of the only two students who got an A in there."
2006, That makes sense to me for a single agent. But for multiple agents I'm not sure I see how returns become marginal? The utility monster could be a billion agents considered as a single entity
2007,"  To the buddhist argument I always wanna say ""I exist! I just contain multitudes üòÖ"""
2008,"  Interesting. I don't like harming other creatures, even small ones. And if my existence relied on billions of other creatures who experience pain and pleasure dying, I'd be very tempted to say ""destroy me!""

And I was like, uuuuuuuuuuh üòÖ"
2685," I generally try to hone in on what that person is excited about and then what problems they may be having in that area. It's partly because I'm curious, and partly because maybe I could help or connect them with someone else who has the same issue or could help.

So quality?"

2716," Yeah, someone who doesn't start assuming you have bad intent whenever they're upset with you, who is willing to put themselves in your place, is a good start. Some people think they've got you ""figured out,"" and they stop seeing you after that. These things take time to determine"
2717, It definitely is more about making decisions that me just generally being there... I might keep using my current name because I agree it does sounds kinda cool :)

2781,"  I want to say ""can't"" like that too, but the other Yankees will beat me up if I do"

Also putting notes in the margins in Latin, oof"
2812, That's encouraging: A hueless world is black and white

2814,  Can I use that as an excuse for when I do something dumb? Presh is pretty high over here üòÖüòÖüòÖ
2815, The change I want to see in the world is the maintenance of a status quo centered around Huel jokes :-|

2818," I don't know if this may be helpful, but as someone who spends a huge amount of time alone without wanting to: I find reading/talking to myself helps, even saying things like ""You're not alone"" to myself and holding my own hand, putting my hand over my heart, etc."

2837,Kinda wishing I could shut my brain down and leave the task of controlling my body to some EA volunteers for a day or two. What could possibly go wrong?
2838,Does anyone happen to have an idea of how to make the topic of 2-3D vectors exciting for undergrads?
2839, It's important to be able to state the hard truths
2840," If I don't go to parties, does that qualify me as being good vacuously?"
2841," It sounds like you're saying, and correct me if I'm wrong, that I can only treat awkwardness in a funny way because I come from a privileged position? I don't deny being in such a position. But what is the take home message? I kind of need humor not to die and stuff."
2842,  I usually come up with some ideas on my own first and then do the fuller literature search. My thing has always been taking knowledge from one domain and applying it in others where people tend not to know or use those things; it's served me well.
2843,  Solid advice. I mean liquid.
2844, But this is how it translates into my mind: https://t.co/EY21lOrMqL

2850," Well, I had this plan to hold the world hostage with a doom's day device, collect the ransom, and then give all the $ to GiveWell...

2859, I'm speaking metaphorically this whole time. And about cheeto dust :-|
2860, The relevant difference is that I haven't been digging it. Prolly should learn to dig it.
2861,It's gotten to that point in the day where there's about one hour left before my bedtime; I'm always like: But I don't wanna go to bed: I WANNA LIVE

2873,Some extra details: The facilitator would be adding his/her thoughts to yours and recording the results of each step digitally using words and graphs.
2874,"5/ My question to you, dear reader, is this: Would you find it useful to role play these groups' positions yourself and be led through the process described above for some issue of importance to you, i.e., to simulate a SAST workshop, but with just you and a facilitator."
2875,"4/ After each group has presented and has its position criticized by the other groups, a synthesis is attempted that factors in the strong points of each group's original position; if a synthesis cannot be reached, at least the key uncertainties have been identified."
2876,3/ Then each group is asked what assumptions they are making about various stakeholders in order for their position to be correct. These assumptions are then rated on certainty and importance: It's the assumptions of high uncertainty and high importance that are crucial.
2877,"2/ Each group defends a position on whatever the issue of relevance happens to be, such that the groups cover a good range of perspectives; for each group, if possible, there's another group defending an opposing view."
2878,"1/ So, there's this systems approach called SAST (Strategic Assumption Surfacing and Testing), in which you would typically do the following with a collection of people after separating them into groups:"
2879," Trying to offset halo effect, in-group-out-group bias, and various other prejudices, using consider-the-opposite, which as far as I know is the only thing that consistently works across many de-biasing studies..."
2880," One trick I use a lot is to imagine as vividly as I can that whoever it is just did the opposite of whatever my first impression of them said to expect. Unless I have something to go on other than ""gut said so"" or the situation is super dangerous..."

2894,  You could post smart things on it!
2895,"4/ I used the viable system model and soft systems methodology as well, to make root definitions of key subsystems and decide how the activities in these systems should relate to one another."
2896,"3/ Meanwhile, each item on the list is marked with importance and urgency indicators to aid in triage."
2897,"2/ Toward this end, I decided that I can power my will-to-get-stuff-done with Linux command line jujitsu, systems thinking, and Latin; I've been finding ways to incorporate all three of these into the items that make their way onto my todo list."
2898,"1/ I've been thinking about how to get the oodles of things I need to do everyday done without going crazy; it seems like the key is the overlap between skills and value: feeling like I'm using what I'm good at, and having the tasks mostly be meaningful."
2899," I think decision-driven data-making is just as useful? Lots of time people collect tons of big data and then don't know what to do with it. But if you have a plan that makes a place for data that you then collect, that works out pretty sweet :)"

2922,"  It would also be interesting to see what implications each idea has... like what feedback loops? E.g., If there are more good posts but also more bad ones, does the reputation of the site suffer? If so, what effect does that have? etc."
2923," I want to lie on the floor too, especially today!"
2924,  Maybe a conversation about the core purpose of the forum would help. Like everyone could answer: What should it do? How should it do it? Toward what ultimate end? And a synthesis of those ideas might give a starting point for dreaming up the ideal picture.

2926," 3/ I'm not certain that I'm not talking past your point; if such is the case, oops, sorry about that..."

2928," 1/ There's an approach called Interactive Planning that takes this idea as a starting point: Instead of focusing on what led to the current level, we imagine, e.g., that the EA forum was destroyed yesterday,"
2929," That's interesting, that sitting with the discomfort a while can also be a helpful thing to do."
2930," Thanks; I'll keep it in there! It's been rewarding for me to apply systems thinking, etc, to that area, for myself and others :)"

2932," I used to play a lot of chess too! And swing dancing is super cool, though I can only watch. (Shuffle dancing is my jam, tho!) So I can remind myself of the wonderful things about my new loves... nice!"
2933," That makes sense, and it's particularly relevant to my current situation, as I'm working on a business while taking care of my official job simultaneously, which hopefully won't always be the case."
2934,"Do you ever feel bad about having put something away, which you love, because it was incurring too much of an opportunity cost relative to other things that are also important to you? If so, how do you handle it?"

2937," Advising involves seeing things first from the advisee's perspective as much as possible, and you built a way forward together. It doesn't really work to give advice ""oracle style"", i.e, proclaiming something wise (alas, since that seems to often come easier to us)."
2938,  Omg we need to have AGI do that first. I want to know what happens before it possibly murders me.
2939," I'm prolly a weird case, but: One of the reasons I had a hard time taking advice growing up was that my parents and others would say something wise but not provide any argument to back it up, e.g., ""You have to love yourself first."" Also mix with unwise things, so noise, ha."

2961, One thing I do to help with remaining open to being wrong is to imagine that I wake up in a world where I am definitely wrong about whatever it is. Then I think about how I'd feel about it and how I'd get along in that world.
