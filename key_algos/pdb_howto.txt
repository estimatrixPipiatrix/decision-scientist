Import the pdb module:

python

import pdb

    Set a breakpoint in your code by adding the following line where you want the debugger to stop:

python

pdb.set_trace()

    Run your code in IPython, and when the execution reaches the pdb.set_trace() line, the debugger will be activated.

    The debugger prompt will appear, and you can use various commands to navigate through the code. Here are some commonly used commands:
        n: Execute the next line of code.
        s: Step into a function call.
        c: Continue execution until the next breakpoint or the end of the program.
        l: Show the current code context.
        p <variable>: Print the value of a variable.
        q: Quit the debugger.
